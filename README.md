### ZachXBT list

ZachXBT @zachxbt -- investigator on X.com -- made a list of OSINT tools he uses for blockchain investigations, but only included name and a short description. This was posted in a telegram group.

I added urls for each, best I could figure out and extra info. I will probably add more tools here soon below the list (I know a few others).
